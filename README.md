# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this analysis was to create an html file showing three maps of earthquake data.  The first was to detect the location of tectonic plates.  The second map showed earthquakes that had a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the Richter scale.  The last map had to show a dark layer background for the map and locations.
